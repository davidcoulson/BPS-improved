"""Where a person is, from the things they own.

A thing can name its owner, a Home Assistant person (thing_owners in the
layout). A person's location is then one of their things' locations, and the
question is which one speaks for them. The phone left on the couch for an
hour does not; the watch that just crossed the room does. So:

1. Only things heard recently (within stale_after_secs) and placed in a room.
2. A thing that arrived where it is within RECENT_MOVE_SECS beats one that
   has sat there longer - it is being carried. Arrival is metres moved
   (settled_since), not the tracker's own "moving" flag: a watch on its
   nightstand whose fix alternates between two points reads as moving. Among those,
   what is usually on a body wins: a pet's own tag, a watch, a phone.
3. When nothing is on the move, the thing that arrived where it is most
   recently wins: the phone that came downstairs this morning, not the
   watch that has sat on its charger since last night. Class does not
   decide here - it did at first, and the watch on the nightstand won.

Only things that give their owner's location take part (locates_owner): by
class a watch, a phone or a person's or pet's own tag; headphones, keys, a
bag only when the thing is switched on for it.
4. Then whichever moved most recently.

Pure: the caller hands in each thing's latest published row.

# Tuning

![The Tuning page: the stability KPI with saved baselines above every tuning knob grouped by what it affects](../img/screenshots/sextant-tuning.png)

The **stability KPI** reads the recorder for any window and reports, per
thing, room changes per hour, the share that were A → B → A flips, and
the median dwell. Save a window as a named baseline and compare later
windows against it; the deltas turn green where the window is better. Every
[tuning key](tuning.md#tuning-reference) is below it with a plain label, its meaning
on hover and the key underneath, grouped by estimator, solver, rooms,
spots, near-field anchor and floors, and applies on the next cycle without
a restart. Position history retention (off, one hour to seven
days) and **Clear history** live here too.

## Tuning reference

Set from the Tuning page or `sextant.set_tuning`. Stored with the layout;
distances in metres.

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `position_estimator` | `geometric` | `geometric`, `fingerprint` or `fused` |
| `fingerprint_weight` | 0.5 | fingerprint share of a fused fix |
| `fingerprint_floor_weight` | 0.5 | fingerprint share of a floor's confidence |
| `fingerprint_k` | 3 | references averaged per fix |
| `fingerprint_missing_m` | 12 | how far "not heard" counts as |
| `fingerprint_ref_gain` | 1.0 | probe beacons hotter (<1) or cooler (>1) than things |
| `fingerprint_auto_gain` | true | learn the rest of that gain from the things |
| `fingerprint_marks` | true | truth marks double as fingerprint references |
| `distance_estimator` | `bermuda` | `bermuda` or `median` |
| `median_window_secs` | 15 | samples newer than this feed the median |
| `median_min_samples` | 3 | fewer falls back to Bermuda's distance |
| `solver_max_receivers` | 8 | nearest proxies per solve (0 = all) |
| `solver_max_range` | 12 | drop readings beyond this once three remain (0 = never) |
| `solver_near_always` | 3 | proxies within this always count |
| `zone_hysteresis` | true | off publishes the instantaneous room |
| `zone_prob_smoothing` | 0.6 | weight on the previous room shares |
| `zone_switch_margin` | 0.15 | lead a challenger room needs |
| `zone_switch_secs` | 20 | held that long before switching |
| `stationary_speed` | 0.3 | m/s; slower is "still" |
| `stationary_secs` | 20 | still this long locks the room |
| `zone_unlock_margin` | 1.0 | metres outside the locked room |
| `zone_unlock_secs` | 30 | for this long to unlock |
| `subzone_switch_secs` | 20 | dwell before a spot change |
| `subzone_enter_prob` | 0.5 | smoothed share needed to enter a spot |
| `subzone_unlock_margin` | 1.0 | metres outside a spot before leaving it |
| `floor_switch_secs` | 60 | a challenger floor must lead this long |
| `floor_tenure_bonus` | 0.05 | extra margin at full tenure |
| `floor_tenure_full_secs` | 600 | tenure counted up to this |
| `floor_proximity_weight` | 0.5 | how much proximity scales a floor's score (0 = fit only) |
| `floor_proximity_k` | 3 | nearest proxies averaged for proximity |
| `anchor_max_m` | 0.8 | anchor when one proxy reads closer than this (0 = off) |
| `anchor_ratio` | 2 | every other proxy at least this many times farther |
| `anchor_secs` | 20 | for this long |
| `anchor_release_m` | 1.5 | release once the reading opens past this |
| `calibration_target` | `sextant` | where Apply writes: `sextant` or `bermuda` |
| `stale_after_secs` | 120 | unheard this long, a thing is drawn as a ghost on Live (display only) |

Two more live at the top level of the layout: `position_timeout` (seconds
before an unheard thing leaves the map, 300) and `thing_height` (the
default carry height in metres, 1.0; per-thing heights come from the
Things page).

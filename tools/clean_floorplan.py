"""Strip a builder's floor plan down to its walls.

A plan drawn for a builder carries far more ink than a positioning map
needs: a tile hatch over every floor, room names, room dimensions, a
title block. All of it competes with what Sextant draws on top - the
rooms you drew, the proxies, the trackers, the spots the Advice page
suggests - and on a phone it wins.

What separates a wall from the rest is mostly weight. A wall is the
heaviest stroke on the sheet; the tile hatch is hairline, and text and
dimension strings sit in between. So:

* a morphological opening keeps only strokes at least ``--thick`` pixels
  across, which is the walls and the heavier door swings;
* the 45-degree rules that fill an "open to below" area are drawn as
  heavily as a wall, so they are caught by shape instead: nothing
  structural holds a straight diagonal for ``--diagonal`` pixels, and
  anything genuinely wall-thick is spared in case a wall runs at an angle;
* ``--dashes`` drops dashed lines - the floor above's footprint, a beam
  overhead - by their stroke length, before the bridging below can chain
  them into something wall-shaped;
* a closing then bridges the small gaps in that skeleton, so a short
  partition between two door frames joins the wall network rather than
  being read as a stray mark;
* components still too small to be a wall - the title block's lettering,
  a stray dimension tick - are dropped.

The result is written as a new image; the original is never touched.
Check it before pointing Sextant at it: every plan is drawn differently,
and ``--thick`` is the knob that matters (raise it if hatch survives,
lower it if walls break up).
